## Introduction

This repository hosts the development of a 16-bit pixel art side-scrolling race game. The project aims to deliver a nostalgic gaming experience while incorporating modern game development practices.

## Getting Started

To get started with the development of the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/side-scrolling-race-game.git
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    # Your installation commands go here
    ```

3. Build and run the game locally:

    ```bash
    # Your build and run commands go here
    ```

## Branching Strategy

- The `main` branch is the primary branch for triggering cloud builds through GitHub Actions.
- The `development` branch is the main branch for ongoing development work. Please create feature branches off `development` for new features or improvements.

Example:

```bash
# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature development
